For the established UIM-COVID-19 assay using RBD as a probe, the IgG and IgM seroconversion times after vaccination were 7.5 and 8.6 days vs. 21.4 and 24 days for the flow cytometry assay, respectively. In addition, using S2-78 as a probe, the UIM-COVID-19 assay could differentiate COVID-19 patients (convalescents) from healthy people and patients with other diseases, with AUCs ranging from 0.85¬ñ0.95. In summary, the UIM-COVID-19 we developed here is a promising ultrasensitive biodetection strategy that has the potential to be applied for both immunological studies and diagnostics.

 In this study of Swedish adults with COVID-19 infection and neurologic symptoms, compared with control participants, viral antigen was detectable in CSF and correlated with CNS immune activation. Patients with COVID-19 had signs of neuroaxonal injury, and neurosymptomatic patients had a more marked inflammatory profile that could not be attributed to differences in COVID-19 severity. These results highlight the clinical relevance of neurologic symptoms and suggest that viral components can contribute to CNS immune responses without direct viral invasion.

The assay has a limit of blank (LOB) of 0.7 pg/mL and lower and upper limit of quantitation (LLOQ, ULOQ) of 3.4 and 1700 pg/mL respectively. LOB was determined by running 20 replicates of zero calibrator and calculating the concentration corresponding to the average zero calibrator signal plus 2.5 standard deviations. LLOQ and ULOQ were determined by running 6 plates on 2 days with 4 replicates per plate. LLOQ was defined as the lowest concentration with a total coefficient of variation (CV) of 20 % or less. ULOQ was defined as the highest concentration with a total CV of 20 % or less. 7 NfL calibrators with concentrations from 6.7 ng/mL to 0.05 pg/mL (7x serially diluted) plus zero calibrator as 8 level were used to establish a standard curve using a weighted logistic fit. Native purified neurofilament light from bovine spinal cord was used to calibrate the assay. Samples were run blinded in duplicates on 14 plates over 2 days. Each plate contained 4 quality control (QC) samples in duplicates: a diluent spiked with 3 NfL concentrations spanning the assay range. Most QC sample concentrations were within 20% of the expected value. Due to limited available sample volume, CSF samples were blinded and diluted 1:10. 25 ¬µL of diluted sample was used per measurement. Despite the fact that samples were diluted, all sample concentrations were measurable and at least one order of magnitude above the assay detection limit.

Our results indicate that the SOMAscan abundance data compare well to other protein analysis platforms. However, use of single protein assessment measures to validate the SOMAscan data has some limitations as follows: a) not all proteins in the SOMAscan array have suitable low throughput options to validate a result; b) the SOMAscan platform has a large dynamic range which may not always be the case for other platforms; c) in general single assessment measures have larger coefficient of variability (CoV) than SOMAscan platform with a 3%¬ñ4% CoV 62 which drives greater precision in any analysis; d) and finally subtly different epitopes may be assessed between the two methods which is common even between ELISAs to the same protein.",,"Suzuki M, Cole JJ, Konno S, Makita H, Kimura H, Nishimura M, Maciewicz RA.",Clin Transl Allergy. 2021 Dec;11(10):e12091. doi: 10.1002/clt2.12091.,Suzuki M,Clin Transl Allergy,2021,12/28/2021,PMC8686766,,10.1002/clt2.12091,,85,0,1,,,,
